.SH NAME
Hive \- Data warehouse infrastructure built atop Hadoop.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B hive
[OPTIONS] --service \fISERVICE\fR [PARAMETERS]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Hive is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data
summarization, ad-hoc querying and analysis of large datasets stored
in Hadoop compatible file systems. Hive provides a mechanism to put
structure on this data and query the data using a SQL-like language
called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional
map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers
when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in
HiveQL.

Please note that Hadoop is a batch processing system and Hadoop jobs
tend to have high latency and incur substantial overheads in job
submission and scheduling. Consequently the average latency for Hive
queries is generally very high (minutes) even when data sets involved
are very small (say a few hundred megabytes). As a result it cannot be
compared with systems such as Oracle where analyses are conducted on a
significantly smaller amount of data but the analyses proceed much
more iteratively with the response times between iterations being less
than a few minutes. Hive aims to provide acceptable (but not optimal)
latency for interactive data browsing, queries over small data sets or
test queries.

Hive is not designed for online transaction processing and does not
support real-time queries or row level insert/updates. It is best used
for batch jobs over large sets of immutable data (like web logs). What
Hive values most are scalability (scale out with more machines added
dynamically to the Hadoop cluster), extensibility (with MapReduce
framework and UDF/UDAF/UDTF), fault-tolerance, and loose-coupling with
its input formats.

\fISERVICE\fR may be one of the following:
  cli           The Hive shell, the default service
  hiveserver    Start the Hive server
  hwi           Hive web interface
  jar           Run a jar that uses Hadoop and Hive APIs
  lineage       Output lineage info for a query
  metastore     Start the Hive metastore

To list available parameters for a service:
.B hive
--service \fISERVICE\fR --help
