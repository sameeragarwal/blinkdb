  <section name="Commons-Math: The Apache Commons Mathematics Library" href="summary">
   <p>
    Commons Math is a library of lightweight, self-contained
    mathematics and statistics components addressing the most common
    problems not available in the Java programming language or Commons
    Lang.
   </p>
   <p>
    Guiding principles:
    <ol>
     <li>
      Real-world application use cases determine development
      priority.
     </li>
     <li>
      This package emphasizes small, easily integrated components
      rather than large libraries with complex dependencies and
      configurations.
     </li>
     <li>
      All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally
      accepted best practices.
     </li>
     <li>
      In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a
      Strategy pattern is used to support multiple
      implementations.
     </li>
     <li>
      Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond Commons
      components and the core Java platform (at least Java 1.3 up to
      version 1.2 of the library, at least Java 5 starting with version
      2.0 of the library).
     </li>
    </ol>

   <subsection name="Releases">
    <p>
      Download the 
      <a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/download_math.cgi">
      Latest Release</a> of Commons Math.

   <!--
   <subsection name="Nightly Builds">
    <p>
     <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/commons/nightly/commons-math/">
     Nightly builds</a> are built once a day from the current SVN HEAD.
     This is (nearly) the latest code and so should be treated with
     caution!
